##### This lab is mainly from the [QEMU Web](https://www.qemu.org/) and [Azeria Labs](https://azeria-labs.com/debugging-with-gdb-introduction/)

Before we can start diving into ARM exploit development we first need to understand the basics of Assembly language programming, which requires a little background knowledge before you can start to appreciate it. But why do we even need ARM Assembly, isn’t it enough to write our exploits in a “normal” programming / scripting language? It is not, if we want to be able to do Reverse Engineering and understand the program flow of ARM binaries, build our own ARM shellcode, craft ARM ROP chains, and debug ARM applications. You don’t need to know every little detail of the Assembly language to be able to do Reverse Engineering and exploit development, yet some of it is required for understanding the bigger picture. 

So what exactly is Assembly language? Assembly language is just a thin syntax layer on top of the machine code which is composed of instructions, that are encoded in binary representations (machine code), which is what our computer understands. So why don’t we just write machine code instead? Well, that would be a pain in the ass. For this reason, we will write assembly, ARM assembly, which is much easier for humans to understand. Our computer can’t run assembly code itself, because it needs machine code. The tool we will use to assemble the assembly code into machine code is a GNU Assembler from the [GNU Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) project named *as* which works with source files having the `*.s` extension.

Once you wrote your assembly file with the extension `*.s`, you need to assemble it with [as](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/index.html#Top) and link it with [ld](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/):

```shell
$ as program.s -o program.o
$ ld program.o -o program
```

In this lab, we will get familiar with basic debugging with GDB. Personally, I prefer using [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) as a GDB extension. It gives a better overview and useful features. You can install it just using the following command in the Raspbian:

```shell
echo source gdbinit-gef.py >> ~/.gdbinit
```
The `gdbinit-get.py` can be downloaded from [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/gdbinit-gef.py).

The debugger is a powerful tool that can:
- Load a memory dump after a crash (post-mortem debugging)
- Attach to a running process (used for server processes)
- Launch a program and debug it

Launch GDB against either a binary, a core file, or a Process ID:
- Attach to a process: `$ gdb -pid $(pidof <process>)`
- Debug a binary: `$ gdb ./file`
- Inspect a core (crash) file: `$ gdb -c ./core.3243`

Now we debug the binary `program` as:

```shell
gdb program
```

If you installed GEF, it drops you the `gef>` prompt, otherwise you see `(gdb)`.

This is how you get help:

```GDB
h
apropos <search-term>
```

Breakpoint commands:

```GDB
break (or just b) <function-name>
break <line-number>
break filename:function
break filename:line-number
break *<address>
del <number>  (delete breakpoint number x)
delete (delete all breakpoints)
delete <range> (delete breakpoint ranges)
disable/enable <breakpoint-number-or-range> (does not delete breakpoints, just enables/disables them)
continue (or just c) – (continue executing until next breakpoint)
continue <number> (continue but ignore current breakpoint number times. Useful for breakpoints within a loop.)
finish (continue to end of function)
```

If you set a breakpoint using label name like:

```GDB
break _start
```
Then you can run the code using:

```GDB
run
```

and wait for the program stopping at the breakpoint:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/images/gef-example.png)

Commands for stepping through the code:

- Step to next line of code. Will step into a function

```GDB
stepi
s
step <number-of-steps-to-perform>
```

- Execute next line of code. Will not enter functions

```GDB
nexti
n
next <number>
```
- Continue processing until you reach a specified line number, function name, address, filename:function, or filename:line-number

```GDB
until
until <line-number>
```

- Show current line number and which function you are in

```GDB
where
```

To stop the program execution

```GDB
kill
```

To exit GDB debugger

```GDB
quit
q
```

Task: 
-----------

Assume we have the following code:

```nasm
.org 0x1000  // Start at memory location 1000
.text        // Code section
.global _start
_start:

mov r4, #77
mov r5, #88
mOV R6, #99

again: 
mov r7, r4
add r4, r6, r4
mov r5, r7
subs r6, r6, #1
bne again

_stop:
b _stop

```

Save the code above in a file called `program.s` and compile it in your QEMU Raspbian with the following commands:

```shell
$ as program.s -o program.o
$ ld program.o -o program
```
Debug the binary `program` using GDB/GEF.

```shell
gdb program
```

```GDB
>gef run
(gdb) run
```

Set breakpoints (Hint: use the label name) to trace the values as it executes that will be placed into the registers r4, r5, r6, and r7:

1. What is the location of your breakpoint in the memory? Why? (Hint: see .org instruction)
2. What is the result for registers after the first loop and the second loop? What is the status for the CPSR? 
3. What is the result for registers after the final loop? What is the status for the CPSR? (Hint: See Zero and Carry)
